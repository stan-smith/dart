# Dart

Point a camera at something. Get an RTSP stream out the other end.

## The Problem

Hardware encoders are expensive. A dedicated box that takes HDMI in and spits RTSP out will set you back £800+. They work fine, but when you've got a pile of cheap capture dongles and a spare Pi lying around, it feels like overkill.

Enter Dart.

## What is Dart?

Dart is a tiny, focused utility that takes video in and streams it out as RTSP. That's it. No frills, no bloat, no £800 price tag.

It's part of the [SlingShot](https://github.com/stan-smith/SlingShot) family of tools, but it stands on its own.

## Inputs

- **HDMI capture cards** — Any V4L2 device. Cheap USB capture dongles work fine.
- **Webcams** — Same deal. If Linux sees it, Dart can use it.
- **RTSP streams** — Transcode and re-stream existing IP cameras.

## Outputs

- **RTSP** — Connect your VMS, your NVR, your SlingShot instance, whatever.

## Quick Start

```bash
# HDMI capture card on /dev/video0
dart --config config.hdmi.toml

# Webcam
dart --config config.webcam.toml

# Re-stream an existing RTSP source
dart --config config.rtsp.toml
```

## Configuration

Dart is highly configurable with sensible defaults. You probably won't need to touch most of it.

```toml
# config.hdmi.toml
[input]
type = "v4l2"
device = "/dev/video0"

[output]
type = "rtsp"
port = 8554
path = "/stream"

[transcode]
codec = "h264"
width = 1920
height = 1080
fps = 25
bitrate = 4000
```

All fields have sane defaults. A minimal config is just a few lines.

## Why GStreamer?

Because it works. Because it's battle-tested. I know how to make RTSP servers from SlingShot, so this is a no brainer.

Dart wraps GStreamer and handles all the pipeline nonsense so you don't have to.

## Hardware Requirements

If it can run Linux and has a USB port, it can probably run Dart.

Tested on:
- Raspberry Pi 4 (1080p/25fps, no sweat)
- Random x86 mini PCs
- Actual servers (overkill, but sure)

## Part of the Family

Dart is a focused breakout from [SlingShot](https://github.com/stan-smith/SlingShot). If you need:

- **Ultra-low bandwidth streaming over QUIC** → SlingShot
- **Simple HDMI/V4L2 to RTSP** → You're in the right place

This is early days. It works for my use case, but your mileage may vary.
